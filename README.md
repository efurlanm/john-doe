# John Doe template without external dependencies

An entire website in a single HTML file that includes CSS, images and content, and no JavaScript.

Based on (see these references for more information):

- and others

What I tried to do was put the CSS and images inside the HTML file, so there were no external dependencies, just a single HTML file and nothing else. The entire website is contained within a single file and works offline without internet. This single file can be emailed and viewed in a regular browser. It also doesn't use Javascript. It can be downloaded and used offline without losing functionality, or it can also be hosted on a simple regular web server.

Images were converted using [base64](https://linux.die.net/man/1/base64). The main john-doe.html file was edited using a text editor ([kwrite](https://apps.kde.org/kwrite/), in my case). For convenience the pages were edited using [MarkText](https://github.com/marktext/marktext) which has the ability to copy and paste the html generated from markdown, however they could have been edited directly in html. The .md files generated by MarkDown can be deleted when they are no longer needed. In the future, if necessary, [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/try/) or [htmlarkdown](https://evitanrelta.github.io/htmlarkdown/) can be used to convert html to markdown.

The template contains an example of a website that on the News page has an external link (https://example.com) that appears with an arrow on the right side indicating an external link that can only be viewed in a browser with Internet access.

The News page is subdivided into articles (tag <article>) each containing a post, which can be expanded using more <article>.
