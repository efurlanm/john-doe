# John Doe template without external dependencies

An entire website in a single HTML file, which includes CSS, images and content, without JavaScript, which occupies 60 kB.

Based on (see these references for more information):

- https://github.com/cadars/john-doe/  (Gregory Cadars' John Doe template)
- https://css-tricks.com/a-whole-website-in-a-single-html-file/
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66522759/how-exactly-does-the-css-in-the-john-doe-no-js-webpage-manage-to-make-the-defaul/
- and others

What I tried to do was to place the CSS and images inside the HTML file eliminating external dependencies, in such a way that there is only a single HTML file and nothing else. It also doesn't use JavaScript. This single file can be emailed and viewed offline in a regular browser without the Internet. It can also be downloaded and used offline without losing functionality, or it can also be hosted on a simple web server.

The main john-doe.html file was edited using a text editor ([kwrite](https://apps.kde.org/kwrite/), in my case). Images webp were converted using [base64](https://linux.die.net/man/1/base64). For convenience the pages were edited using [MarkText](https://github.com/marktext/marktext) which has the ability to copy and paste the html generated from markdown, however they could have been edited directly using html. The .md files generated by MarkText can be deleted when they are no longer needed. In the future, if necessary, [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/try/) or [htmlarkdown](https://evitanrelta.github.io/htmlarkdown/) can be used to convert from html to markdown.

The example contained in the template has external links that appear with an arrow on the right side, in order to indicate an external link that can only be viewed in a browser with Internet access. This is important, for example, when browsing offline.

The News page is subdivided into articles (tag `<article>`) each containing a post, which can be expanded.

The John Doe template complies with [Jeff Huang's 7 guidelines](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/) from *This Page is Designed to Last*:

1. Return to vanilla HTML/CSS
   - Does not have JavaScrip, and passes the https://validator.w3.org/
2. Don't minimize that HTML
   - Neither the CSS nor the HTML are minimized, and furthermore an attempt was made to comment out the HTML code
3. Prefer one page over several
   - The HTML file is unique and does not have any external references, both the CSS and the images are inside the single file
4. End all forms of hotlinking
   - With the exception of example links that can be deleted, there is no hotlink or external link
5. Stick with native fonts
   - There are no external fonts and only two font families are used: `font-family: system-ui, sans-serif;`
6. Obsessively compress your images
   - All example images contained in the template use webp format converted to base64, and are at the minimum size
7. Eliminate the broken URL risk
   - At the moment the site is hosted on Github which I think is stable and will always be online, but using a monitoring service is always a good idea. And on the other hand, since it's a single HTML file, it can be easily downloaded and stored offline, so it should be relatively easy to preserve (I think)
