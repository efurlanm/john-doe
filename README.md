# John Doe template without external dependencies

This is my version of the John Doe (JD) template by Gregory Cadars, a complete and simple website contained in a single HTML file including CSS, images and content, without JavaScript or external dependencies, occupying only 60 kB.

Based on:

What I tried to do was pack everything (CSS, images, data, HTML) into a single HTML file with no external dependencies, in such a way that there is only a single HTML file and nothing else. This lack of dependencies is often very convenient as it makes it impossible for the parts of an HTML to separate, and thus increases the chances of it still working in the future. It also doesn't use JavaScript, making it simple and small. This single file can be sent via email and viewed offline in a regular browser without the Internet, or it can be downloaded directly from the browser and viewed offline without losing functionality, and it can also be easily hosted on a cheap and simple web server.

The main john-doe.html file was edited using a text editor ([kwrite](https://apps.kde.org/kwrite/), in my case). Images webp were converted using [base64](https://linux.die.net/man/1/base64). For convenience the pages were edited using [MarkText](https://github.com/marktext/marktext) which has the ability to copy and paste the html generated from markdown, however they could have been edited directly using html. The .md files generated by MarkText can be deleted when they are no longer needed, and in the future, if needed, [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/try/) or [htmlarkdown](https://evitanrelta.github.io/htmlmarkdown/) can be used to convert the html back to markdown.

The example contained in the template has external links that appear with an arrow on the right side, in order to indicate an external link that can only be viewed in a browser with Internet access. This is important, for example, when browsing offline.

The News page is subdivided into articles (tag `<article>`) each containing a post, which can be expanded.

The John Doe template complies with [Jeff Huang's 7 guidelines](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/) from *This Page is Designed to Last*:

1. Return to vanilla HTML/CSS
   - Does not have JavaScrip, and passes the https://validator.w3.org/
2. Don't minimize that HTML
   - Neither the CSS nor the HTML are minimized, and furthermore an attempt was made to comment out the HTML code
3. Prefer one page over several
   - It's a single HTML file and everything is inside this single file, there is no other external file
4. End all forms of hotlinking
   - There are no images from other websites, the CSS is part of the file and is not externally linked, it does not use Google Analytics, nor any type of hotlink
5. Stick with native fonts
   - There are no external fonts, and only generic font families are used
6. Obsessively compress your images
   - All example images contained in the template use webp format (converted to base64), and are at the minimum size
7. Eliminate the broken URL risk
   - At the moment the site is hosted on Github which I think is stable and will always be online, but using a monitoring service is always a good idea. And on the other hand, since it's a single HTML file, it can be easily downloaded and stored offline, so it should be relatively easy to preserve

The main idea of JD I think is being able to open a file using a simple text editor, make all the necessary changes, save, and that's it. If I want to copy some part of another JD to mine, I just need to open the 2 files, copy (Ctrl+V) and paste (Ctrl-+V), save, and that's it. I can also edit and append using html. If I need any additional resources, I use another external software of my choice, which could be, for example, a website with an online app.
