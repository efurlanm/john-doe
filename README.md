# John Doe template

A Whole Website in a Single HTML File

Based on:
- https://github.com/cadars/john-doe/
- https://css-tricks.com/a-whole-website-in-a-single-html-file/

What I did was insert the CSS and images converted to base64, inside the HTML file, in such a way that there are no external dependencies. The website works offline without Internet, and the HTML file can be emailed and viewed in an offline browser. It also doesn't use Javascript.
