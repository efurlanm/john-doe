# John Doe template without external dependencies

An entire website in a single HTML file that includes CSS, images and content, but no JavaScript.

See the references for more information.

What I tried to do was insert the CSS and the images, converted to base64, inside the HTML file, in such a way that there are no external dependencies. The website works offline without Internet, and the HTML file can be emailed and viewed in an offline browser. It also doesn't use Javascript.

It can be downloaded and used offline without losing functionality, or it can also be hosted on a simple regular web server.
