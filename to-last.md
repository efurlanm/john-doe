<h2>Designed To Last</h2>

Based on [Designed to Last by Jeff Huang](http://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/) (see this link for more information). Summarizing the 7 guidelines (2023-02-20):

1. Return to default HTML/CSS
2. Don't minimize this HTML
3. Prefer one page over several
4. End all forms of hotlinking
5. Use native fonts
6. Compress your images obsessively
7. Eliminate the risk of broken URL

<br>

In addition, I will also include my personal guidelines:

8. Easy to download for later offline viewing without Internet
9. Single HTML file without JavaScript or external dependencies

## Save

As this entire website is contained within a single HTML file with no external dependencies, it is simple to save it to disk for later reading, thus helping to preserve it through an offline copy. To save it, just use the browser's page save option, that's all. After saving, check if it is working by clicking on the file and selecting open in browser. If it doesn't work, maybe you need to turn off some browser add-ons.

## Preserve

If you intend to fork and use this template, please include as much comments and information as possible within the HTML file so that in the future people can easily understand what was done, how it was done, and eventually contribute too.
